                    <p>The Kingdom of Tonga doesn’t often attract global attention, but a violent eruption of 
                        an underwater volcano on January 15 has spread shock waves, quite literally, around half 
                        the world.</p>

                    <p>Great Sendai Earthquake or Great Tōhoku Earthquake, severe natural disaster that occurred in northeastern Japan 
                        on March 11, 2011. The event began with a powerful earthquake off the northeastern coast of Honshu, Japan’s main island, 
                        which caused widespread damage on land and initiated a series of large tsunami waves that devastated many coastal areas of 
                        the country, most notably in the Tōhoku region (northeastern Honshu). The tsunami also instigated a major nuclear accident 
                        at a power station along the coast.</p>

                    <p>The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami (also known as the Boxing Day Tsunami and, by the scientific community, 
                        the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake[10][11]) occurred at 07:58:53 local time (UTC+7) on 26 December, with an epicentre off 
                        the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 
                        9.1–9.3 Mw, reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas. The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the 
                        fault between the Burmese Plate and the Indian Plate.</p>

                    <p>On May 31, 1970, a 7.9-magnitude earthquake caused one of Peru's deadliest landslides, according to the BBC. The quake 
                        emanated around 22 miles (35 km) from Mount Huascarán, Peru's highest mountain. The force of the earthquake caused massive 
                        landslides that buried surrounding towns, in particular Yungay and Ranrahirca. .</p>

                    <p>On Sept. 8, 1900, a storm swept through Galveston, an island off the coast of Texas. At the time, Galveston was one of 
                        Texas's biggest port cities, but a hurricane with 140 mph (225 km/h) winds swept it off the map. It's estimated that 
                        3,600 houses and 600 businesses were reduced to rubble across 1,900 acres (770 hectares), according to the Texas Historical Foundation. 

                        Although it remains unclear exactly how many people perished during the hurricane, the final death toll was estimated 
                        to be between 6,000 and 8,000 people — one-sixth of the island's population, according to the foundation.</p>
